# CopyCameraProperties-Unity
This C# Script copies camera properties from an origin camera to a target camera.

This is a simple utility script that I use in my projects.
  
## Usage :
1) Attach to a camera game object.  
2) Select origin camera to copy from.  
3) Select target camera to copy to.  
4) Select copy mode.  
Optional : With some copy modes, you can adjust the ratio of copying with the Reduction Factor float variable.
